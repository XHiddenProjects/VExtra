# Vextra Studio

A desktop workspace (Tauri v2 + plain JavaScript) for **web development** and **2D / 3D game making**.

- **Code editor** (Ace) with live web preview and device frames
- **UI designer** – drag components onto a canvas, export HTML
- **Game editor** – 2D and 3D scenes, 100 visual logic blocks (Triggers, Logic & Math, Components, Properties, Text & Lists, GUI, Game Flow, Mobile Device, Behavior Bundles), a script view of the same logic, and your own assets: pixel-art sprites, a sound synthesizer with step sequencer, voxel / shape / OBJ models
- **Play, device simulator, export to a single HTML file**
- **Plugins** with in-app documentation (Docs → Plugins), themes
- **Accounts, collaboration, public hosting** via the bundled sharing server

## Run it
Requires Node.js 18+ and Rust (rustup). On Linux you also need the Tauri system packages (webkit2gtk etc., see tauri.app/start/prerequisites).

```
npm install        # also copies Ace + three.js into renderer/vendor
npm start          # desktop app (tauri dev)
npm run build      # installer / bundle
npm run web        # browser-only mode on http://localhost:5173 (no Rust needed; files are kept in memory)
npm test           # syntax checks + end-to-end test of the sharing server
```

## Share, collaborate, host
```
npm run server     # sharing server on http://localhost:8787  (PORT, DATA_DIR, PUBLIC_URL, ALLOW_REGISTER=0)
```
In the app: Cloud panel → *Server* → your URL → create an account → *Publish current project*. Games and sites are served at `/p/<user>/<name>/`; collaborators join with an invite code and sync every few seconds. To make links public, run the server on a machine/host that is reachable from the internet (put it behind HTTPS, e.g. Caddy or nginx) and set `PUBLIC_URL`.

## Uninstall / clean up
```
npm run clean            # remove build artefacts (node_modules, src-tauri/target, renderer/vendor)  – alias: npm run autoclean
npm run uninstall        # interactive; choose clean or full
npm run uninstall:auto   # no questions: artefacts + Vextra's settings, plugins, themes, saved sign-in
node scripts/uninstall.js --mode=full --dry-run          # preview only
node scripts/uninstall.js --mode=full --auto --toolchain  # also uninstall rustup (asks you to type a confirmation)
```
Your own projects and games are never deleted. The same clean-up of app data is available in the app under Settings.

## Write a plugin
Drop a `.js` file in the plugins folder (Plugins panel → Open folder) with a `/** @forge-plugin {...} */` manifest and an optional `/** @forge-docs ... */` block. See `plugins/` for examples and Docs → Plugins → Plugin API.

## What's new in 3.6.0
- **Layers** (Background / World / UI) with show / lock, and UI-layer objects that stay on screen.
- **Edit UI layout:** drag labels and bars to where you want them, or type the anchor and X / Y.
- **Live cursor + selected-object position** in the 2D and 3D viewports.
- Object scripts are now **behaviours** (Logic tab) – old projects convert automatically.
- **All ten example games are block graphs** – open one in Logic and read or rewire it. New **Light** block for live 3D lights.
- New **[ACCESSIBILITY.md](ACCESSIBILITY.md)**.

## What's new in 3.5.0
- **Ten example games** (5 × 2D, 5 × 3D) in Library → Games.
- **Store Export** checks Java / Gradle / Android SDK automatically (JAVA_HOME), installs and updates them for you, and shows a simple checklist.
- Voice Command speech-service fallback, mouse-look and kinematic-gravity fixes. See `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Community files: contributing guide, code of conduct, issue and pull request templates.

## What's new in 3.4.1
- Microphone and camera blocks now work in the editor's Play panel (the editor hands the devices to the sandboxed game), with clear error messages.

## What's new in 3.4.0
- **Realism**: physically based materials + screen effect for hyper-realistic 3D.
- **New block groups**: Microphone, Camera, VR and AR (with desktop fallbacks).
- Custom shader / material **drop-downs** in the Shader block and the Inspector.

## What's new in 3.3.0
- **Drag to reorder** editor tabs, bottom-panel tabs and sidebar icons.
- **Vextra AI**: Build & change site permission, checkpoints (Continue), token usage bar, context window for every provider, time-out lock, Reconnect with auto-countdown, more providers.
- **Security**: CodeQL findings in Vextra Shield fixed (see `SECURITY.md`).

### Pushing to GitHub (Git LFS)
`vextra-server.exe` (the bundled local server, built by `npm run build:server`) is about 100 MB, and GitHub rejects normal files that large. It is stored with **Git LFS** instead (`.gitattributes` already lists it, and it is not in `.gitignore`):
```
# once, after installing Git LFS from https://git-lfs.com
npm run lfs:setup
git add .gitattributes src-tauri/resources/server
git commit -m "Add server binary via LFS"
git push
```
If the exe was already committed *without* LFS, convert it: `git lfs migrate import --include="src-tauri/resources/server/vextra-server.exe" --everything`, then `git push --force-with-lease`. GitHub's free plan allows 2 GB per LFS file but only 10 GiB of LFS storage + bandwidth per month; for many releases publish builds on the **Releases** page instead.

## What's new in 3.2.0
- **Vextra Shield** security plugin with a ⚙ Configure button; plugin hooks and `forge.config`.
- **One Animation block** for everything (sprite/model/clip, Auto walk-idle-jump), synced with its target; **F3** cycles 1st / 3rd-back / 3rd-front camera in 3D.
- **Vextra AI** plugin (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Ollama… with Deny/Ask/Allow permissions) and **account security** (authenticator app, recovery codes, security keys).
- **Start local server** button in the desktop app (bundled server, no terminal); every object/target field is a dropdown; settings open as `plugin:<name>` tabs.
- Fixed leftover outlines when scaling 3D objects. `esbuild` install script allowed by default.

## What was new in 3.1.0
- Separate **animation studios** for sprites and 3D models (🎞 Animate tab), with a calm, paused-by-default preview.
- **2D lights** with scene darkness; clearer 3D light helpers.

## What was new in 3.0.0
- **Library**: install website templates and 2D/3D games from a URL, GitHub repo or catalog (defaults included).
- **Animation clips**, **material files** (also in the model editor), a 25-effect **shader** list with modes and custom shader files.
- Blocks: self-connect, Switch / Toggle switch, Number rounding, Collision side, Cursor *none*, icons on blocks and file types, resizable block settings.
- **Store Export** installs, assigns and builds automatically with a progress bar.
- Flexible layout that reflows with the window; more default 2D/3D assets; read-only notice moved to the top of the code pane.
- Build scripts: `npm run build:win`, `build:linux`, `build:mac` (replaces `build:exe`).

## What was new in 2.0.0
- Web projects: any file type, a built-in SQLite database (browse/edit/SQL/import/export), `window.VXDB` in previews, PHP run (desktop, needs PHP installed), local-server preview, and **Export website** to ZIP / tar.gz with `.htaccess`, `nginx.conf`, database and deploy notes.
- Games: `Once` trigger, Expression variables a–f, camera view width/height, GUI banner ads with an ad-service choice (house, image, HTML tag, AdSense, own code), first-person 3D demo, blank new projects (demos under the Command Palette), labels that survive restarts, working device frames in Play.
- Editor: collapsible block palette / settings / nodes, panels that adapt to window size, real Simple vs Advanced modes.
- Markdown Preview plugin: outline, syntax-highlighted code with line numbers and a Copy button that follows the scroll. Docs use the same code blocks.

## Known limits (please read)
- The Rust side (`src-tauri`) was written but **not compiled** in the environment this was built in. The whole front end, game runtime, and server were run and tested in a headless browser. The PHP-server and local-preview-server code was compiled and run on its own (std only) but not inside Tauri. Expect to fix small compile errors on first `npm start`.
- PHP features need PHP installed on your computer. AdSense / ad tags need your own approved account and internet access. Store export prepares build-ready projects; signing and uploading need your own developer accounts.
- Ads, Game Center, achievements and device features are web fallbacks / simulations with hooks, not native SDK integrations.
- No glTF import (voxel, primitive-group and OBJ models only).
- Plugin blocks must be self-contained functions to survive export.
- Legacy `.forgescene` files are converted best-effort. Data from the old McDev app folder is not migrated.
