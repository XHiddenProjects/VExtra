## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security problems. Use GitHub's **private vulnerability reporting** (the repository's *Security* tab → *Report a vulnerability*); no email address is needed. Include a description, reproduction steps and the affected version. You will get an acknowledgement within 5 working days; fixes are released as patch versions and listed in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## How Vextra Studio protects you

- **Sandboxed previews.** Game *Play* and web *Preview* run in sandboxed iframes without `allow-same-origin`, so user code cannot reach the editor, your files or the Tauri bridge.
- **Authenticated cross-window messaging.** Every parent ⇄ preview message carries a random per-session token (`VX.channel`). The editor ignores messages without the token or from a different `source` window, and replies are posted to a pinned origin. The one exception is the Play iframe: it is sandboxed with an *opaque* origin, which browsers only address with `'*'`. That channel is protected by the token and the `source` check instead, and carries no secrets beyond the session token.
- **Local servers** (PHP preview, "Local server") bind to `127.0.0.1` only and serve only the opened project folder; path traversal is rejected.
- **Archive writers** strip `..` and absolute path segments from entry names.
- **Plugins** run with editor privileges. Only install plugins you trust; review the source first.
- **Dependencies** are declared with `^` ranges and refreshed for each release (`npm audit`, `cargo update`).

## Known advisories

### RUSTSEC-2024-0429 – unsoundness in `Iterator`/`DoubleEndedIterator` for `glib::VariantStrIter` (glib 0.18.5)

- **Status:** not exploitable from Vextra Studio; cannot be upgraded yet.
- **Why:** `glib 0.18` is a *transitive* dependency of the Linux GTK3 stack (`gtk → tao / muda / wry → tauri 2.x`). The fixed `glib ≥ 0.20` is a semver-incompatible GTK-rs release that Tauri 2 does not yet use, and `Cargo.lock` is already at the newest compatible versions of every crate (`cargo update` makes no change).
- **Our code:** Vextra never calls `glib::VariantStrIter` (or any `glib::Variant` API); the affected iterator is not reachable from our Rust sources or from the web frontend.
- **Scope:** Linux builds only. Windows and macOS builds do not link glib.
- **Plan:** moves with Tauri. We will upgrade as soon as a Tauri release depends on a fixed glib. Track this entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Hardening tips for deployments

- Keep the optional cloud/sharing server (`npm run server`) behind HTTPS and set a strong secret.
- Exported websites ship `.htaccess` / `nginx.conf` with conservative headers; review them for your host.

## Static analysis

The repository is scanned by GitHub CodeQL. Values embedded in generated inline `<script>` blocks are serialised with `VX.jsLit`, which escapes `<`, `>`, `&`, U+2028 and U+2029, so they cannot terminate the script or inject code.

## v3.0.0 additions (still apply in 3.1.0)
- **Library downloads** (`http_download`): https only, 50 MB cap, archive paths sanitised, user confirmation before anything is written. Templates and games are code: install only from sources you trust.
- **Process runner** (`run_start`): only `npm`, `npx`, `node`; working directory must be inside a `store-export` folder; arguments limited to `[A-Za-z0-9@./:=,+-_]`; no shell is used. npm packages named in generated `package.json` files run their install scripts as usual.

## v3.12.0 notes
- **Auto-updater:** updates are verified with a minisign public key compiled from `src-tauri/updater/pubkey.txt`; an unsigned or tampered download is rejected. The private key lives only in GitHub secrets (never in the repo), the endpoint is HTTPS-only, no `dangerous*` options are used, and the updater commands are Rust-side only (no `updater:default` capability for the webview). The downgrade guard (`requireSignedVersion`) is not enabled yet.

## v3.11.3 notes
- **MSI data removal:** deleting data on uninstall is destructive, so it is opt-in at every step: the question defaults to *No* (also after a 2-minute timeout), a silent uninstall deletes nothing unless `REMOVEUSERDATA=1` is passed, upgrades never delete (`UPGRADINGPRODUCTCODE`), and the paths are fixed (`%APPDATA%\studio.vextra.app`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\studio.vextra.app`) – never a folder the user chose. The question is a small inline JScript custom action; it only shows a Yes / No box and sets a property, and its failure is ignored (`Return="ignore"`). Some antivirus products treat any script custom action in an MSI as suspicious; the installers are unsigned anyway (see v3.11.0 notes) – verify downloads against `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- **Updater:** there is no auto-updater and no updater signing key; the workflow no longer asks for updater signatures. If an updater is added later, its private key must be stored as an encrypted repository secret, never in the repository.
- **Delete-everything button:** it only touches Vextra's own data folder and browser storage and asks for confirmation first.

## v3.11.2 notes
- **Workflow dependencies:** the release and Pages workflows use the newest major versions of the official actions (`actions/*`, `tauri-apps/tauri-action`, `swatinem/rust-cache`, `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`) and the newest runner images and Node.js LTS, so they get upstream security fixes. Actions are referenced by major-version tag, not pinned to a commit hash; if your threat model requires it, pin them to full commit SHAs (Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem can keep those up to date). Permissions are unchanged: `contents: write` only for the build / checksum jobs, `pages: write` + `id-token: write` only for the Pages deploy.

## v3.11.1 notes
- **Pages workflow:** no longer triggered by releases (tags cannot deploy to the protected `github-pages` environment). It keeps the minimum permissions (`contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`); the deploy step is the only one that can publish, and only from the default branch.

## v3.11.0 notes
- **Store Export for VR / AR (Steam):** the generated launcher serves the game from a local http server bound to `127.0.0.1` on a random port (path-traversal safe, `Cache-Control: no-store`) and starts the player's installed Edge / Chrome with a separate profile folder; nothing is reachable from the network. The generated Android / iOS projects only add the permissions a VR / AR game needs (camera for AR, motion sensors) and iOS explains them to the player.
- **Blender live link:** off until you press *Start link* in Blender. The add-on's server listens on `127.0.0.1` only (never the network), every request except a harmless `/ping` needs the random pairing key (constant-time compare; *New key* in the add-on preferences revokes it), uploads are capped at 200 MB and models sent from Vextra are imported with Blender's own glTF / OBJ importers. The key is stored in the editor's local storage on your computer. Anyone who can already run code on your computer could read the key, which is why the link is not a security boundary against local malware.
- **Release builds (GitHub Actions):** `release-build.yml` runs only when a release is published (or when someone with write access starts it by hand). It uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write` limited to the build and checksum jobs, needs no other secrets, validates the release ID as a number and passes it through environment variables (no shell injection from release text). Every installer gets a SHA-256 in `SHA256SUMS.txt`. **The installers are not code-signed or notarised**, so Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper warn on first start – verify the hash against `SHA256SUMS.txt` and download only from the Releases page of this repository.
- **Live demo site (GitHub Pages):** `pages.yml` publishes a static copy of the browser build (`scripts/build-web.js`). It runs entirely in the visitor's browser: no server, no accounts, nothing uploaded; projects stay in that browser's storage. The workflow has read access to the code and write access only to the Pages deployment. Plugins in the demo are the built-in ones; the sandboxed Play / Preview frames behave exactly as in the app.

## v3.10.0 notes
- **Model loaders:** `.glb` / `.gltf` are parsed by three.js' official GLTFLoader (bundled, no network access, no external URIs – only data inside the file). Draco and Meshopt are decoded by their official WebAssembly decoders; Draco runs in a Web Worker created from a Blob and fed only the file's bytes. Files over 40 MB are refused.
- **Importing other formats (FBX, DAE, STL, PLY, 3MF):** the readers run only in the editor, are loaded on demand, and the result is re-saved as an ordinary `.glb`; they are never included in exported games. Imports are limited to 60 MB. Textures that would need a file path or URL are dropped, so an imported file can never make the editor fetch anything.
- **Bluetooth permission:** the Play frame is allowed to ask for *bluetooth* (and usb / serial / hid); the browser still shows its own picker and nothing is paired without a click.
- **Blender add-on / optimizer script:** plain, readable scripts. The add-on only calls Blender's own glTF exporter; the optimizer runs `npx @gltf-transform/cli` (downloaded from npm on first use) – read it before running.

## v3.9.0 notes
- **Bluetooth blocks** use Web Bluetooth: the browser always shows its own picker (needs a click / key / touch and https or localhost), a game can only reach the device you choose and the services listed in the block, and nothing pairs in the background. Connections are closed when the game stops.
- **Plugin block demo clips:** `demo.video` is accepted only as an `https://` or relative `.webm` / `.mp4` link (never `javascript:` / `data:`), shown muted in a `<video>` element with no autoplay.
- **Live values view:** only in the editor – the game sends short text previews of block outputs (max 34 characters each) to the editor over the same one-time-token channel as logs; exported games never send them unless the editor asks.
- **Readable values:** the new text conversion only reads values; it never evaluates anything.
- **GLB / glTF import:** a built-in parser (no third-party code) reads only the file's own bytes. Limits: 40 MB per file, node depth 64; Draco / Meshopt-compressed files are refused; a `.gltf` may only use embedded `data:` buffers and images (no file or network references); images are decoded by the browser from a `Blob`. A model that cannot be read is replaced by a wireframe box and a console warning – it never stops the game.
- **Voice commands – local and cloud speech services:** a *local model* address must be on this computer (`localhost`, `127.x.x.x`, `[::1]`); a *cloud service* address must use `https://`. Both are checked again when listening starts. The service key is stored on your computer only and is sent only to the address you typed, as a Bearer header. Audio is sent only while a Voice Command block is listening, and these services work only while testing in Vextra – exported games never contain a key and use the player's own browser speech recognition.
- **3D Text objects** are drawn on a canvas with `fillText` (text only, never HTML); the `{variable}` template is the same one Labels use.
- **Documentation clips:** the docs play only local `.webm` / `.mp4` files from `docs/clips/` (muted, with controls, no autoplay) and pass the path through the same URL check as images. The clip generator in `tools/block-demos/` is a developer tool and is not part of the app.
- **XR demo games** (VR / AR) use the existing VR / AR blocks; they request camera or headset access only when you press Enter VR / Start AR.

## v3.8.0 notes
- **Loading page** (`settings.loading`): the title, subtitle, tips and colours you type are HTML-escaped when the page is generated, colours must be `#hex` values, and the logo must be a `data:image/` URL taken from your own sprites. Nothing from these settings is evaluated as code.
- **Credit footer** for exported websites and UI designs is fixed text with no links or scripts; only its alignment and colours are configurable.
- **Store Export toolchain:** downloads still use HTTPS to the same fixed list of hosts with SHA-256 verification. The new retry only repeats the same verified request (up to 4 times) after network errors; a download that fails its checksum is never retried or used. Java 27 is the requested JDK.
- **CodeQL fix (incomplete string escaping):** the Gradle wrapper URL written to `gradle-wrapper.properties` now has backslashes escaped before colons, and replacements use function replacers so `$` sequences in a value are never interpreted.
- **Touch blocks** (Joystick, Touch Button, Touch Look) only create DOM elements and synthetic key / mouse-move events inside the game; sprites come from your own project and labels are set as text, never HTML.
- **Loading page:** the minimum display time is clamped to 1.5–10 seconds.
- **Spawn fix:** an `undefined` override no longer replaces a default value on a spawned object.

## v3.6.0 notes
- **Script → behaviour conversion** only moves text from one field of the project file to another; nothing is executed during conversion. Code behaviours run exactly as before: inside the sandboxed Play frame / exported page, never in the editor's own context.
- The **Logic tab preview** of a code behaviour runs the script once against inert stand-ins (`game`, `self`, `VXRT`… do nothing), so previewing no longer reaches real engine services such as the microphone or camera.
- **UI layout** (`scene.uiLayout`) stores only an anchor name and two numbers per element id; values are validated as numbers/known anchors when applied and are never evaluated as code.
- Layer visibility / lock in the editor is view-only state and is not saved into the game.
- **Example games are block graphs**, so they run through the same block runtime as any project (Expressions are parsed by the engine's arithmetic parser, not `eval`). The new **Light** block only sets a light's numeric brightness and a colour string on the object.
- Accessibility reports can be filed publicly (see `ACCESSIBILITY.md`); security problems should still go through the process above.

## v3.5.0 notes
- **Android toolchain auto-install (Store Export):** HTTPS only; hosts limited to api.adoptium.net, github.com / githubusercontent.com, services.gradle.org / downloads.gradle.org, developer.android.com and dl.google.com; every archive's SHA-256 is verified before it is unpacked; archive paths are checked (no zip-slip); installs go to your user folder (`~/.vextra/toolchain`), never need administrator rights, and no shell is used except Gradle's own launcher. The process runner restrictions above are unchanged.
- **Speech service fallback** is off unless you set a URL and key in Settings. The key is stored in the app settings on your computer and audio is sent only to that URL while a Voice Command block is listening.
- Example games are ordinary projects (scripts included) – review any game you import from elsewhere.

## v3.4.1 notes
- The editor's Play frame stays sandboxed (no `allow-same-origin`). Instead of loosening it for the microphone and camera, the editor opens the devices and sends the game only data (audio analysis arrays, small camera frames, recognised text). Only the frame the panel started may ask (one-time token + source check); the streams are stopped when the game stops, and nothing leaves the computer.

## v3.4.0 notes
- **Microphone, camera, VR and AR** blocks ask the browser for permission and only work while the game is open. Microphone sound and camera frames are analysed **locally in memory** (level, motion, colour) – no audio or video is recorded, stored or sent anywhere by Vextra. The *Photo* block keeps a picture only in a game variable (or a download the player triggers). Speech recognition (Voice Command) is done by the browser's own service, which may send audio to its vendor (Google / Apple) – mention this in your game's privacy notice.
- Games run inside a sandboxed frame in the editor; the frame is allowed `microphone`, `camera` and `xr-spatial-tracking` only (no geolocation, no clipboard).
- Streams are released when a block stops, the scene changes or the game is closed (reference-counted, so the camera light turns off).

## v3.3.0 notes
- **CodeQL findings fixed** (`plugins/vextra-shield.js`): *Improper code sanitization* (×3) – the exported-game scripts (save guard, embed guard) are now fixed text and read their settings from escaped `data-` attributes instead of having JSON spliced into JavaScript; *Bad HTML filtering regexp* – script-tag matching now also handles end tags such as `</script foo>`. The same regular expression was corrected in the AI site preview and the web tools.
- **Repository hygiene**: the generated server binary (`vextra-server[.exe]`) is stored with Git LFS and installers are git-ignored; publish release builds with checksums and verify downloads against them. LFS objects are fetched from GitHub over HTTPS like any other file.
- **Vextra AI**: new *Build & change site* permission (Deny / Ask / Allow); website files are written only under it, and `new_site` never overwrites existing files. Stop now aborts a pending request or approval immediately. The *Context window* limit trims what is sent to the provider.
- Dependencies were updated to their latest releases (`npm audit`: 0 known vulnerabilities).
- Drag-to-reorder uses the pointer only and moves no data outside the window.

## v3.1.0 notes (still apply in 3.3.0)
- No new network, file or process permissions. The new animation studios, 2D lights and model poses are pure front-end features that run inside the existing sandboxed game preview.
- Sprite/model animation data is stored as plain JSON inside the game file and is validated on load (frame indices outside the sprite are dropped; unknown track names are ignored).

## v3.2.0 notes
- **Vextra Shield** (built-in plugin, configurable via its ⚙ button) hardens exported games with a Content-Security-Policy (inline scripts pinned by SHA-256, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, `form-action 'none'`, network limited to HTTPS/WSS plus hosts you list; `unsafe-eval` stays because the engine and code behaviours need it), signs local saves to detect edits, enforces a password policy and client-side sign-in lockout, signs out idle sessions, warns before sending passwords over `http://` to non-local servers, and scans files for secrets before publishing. These are defence-in-depth measures: client-side checks can be bypassed by someone modifying the app, so the server's own controls (scrypt hashing, rate limiting) remain authoritative.
- New plugin hooks (`game.export.html`, `account.*`, `publish.before`) let plugins veto or change those actions. Plugins already run with editor privileges, so only install plugins you trust.
- `package.json` allows install scripts only for `esbuild` (`allowScripts` for npm 11.16+/12, `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`, `trustedDependencies`, `dependenciesMeta`). Review any dependency before adding it to those lists.
- Fixed: selection outlines left in the 3D editor after scaling (no security impact).
- **Two-step sign-in** (server): authenticator-app codes (TOTP, SHA-1/6 digits/30 s, ±1 step, a code cannot be reused), 8 one-time recovery codes (stored hashed), and WebAuthn security keys (ES256, attestation `none`, signature-counter check). The second step uses a 5-minute ticket limited to 6 tries, plus the per-IP rate limit. Turning it on/off, adding/removing keys and new recovery codes require the account password. The TOTP secret is stored in the server's `users.json` (protect the data folder like any credential store). Keys only work from the app address they were added from.
- **Vextra AI** plugin: prompts and anything the AI reads go to the provider you choose (local providers stay on your computer). API keys are stored in Vextra's local settings. Abilities (read, edit open file, create & edit files, delete/move, build & change game) are Deny / Ask / Allow; file deletion and moves have their own permission and never touch `.git`, `node_modules` or secret-looking files; secret-looking files (`.env`, keys, certificates) are never read or written; writes stay inside the open folder. Treat model output as untrusted – review changes you allow automatically (Agent mode).
- **Local server** started from the desktop app listens on `127.0.0.1` only and keeps its data in the app's data folder. `forge.net.request` only allows `https://` (and `http://localhost`).
- Store Export projects approve install scripts only for `electron`, `sharp` and `esbuild`.
